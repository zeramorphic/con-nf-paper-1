\section{Actions}

When proving and interacting with the freedom of action theorem, we may not have a locally-defined permutation, but just a locally-defined function that may not have complete orbits.
Such a function is called an \emph{action}.
The definitions of approximations and actions differ in various ways because of their different use-cases.
In this section we discuss actions, and how they may be turned into approximations.
